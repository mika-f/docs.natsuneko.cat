This add-on supports the following platforms:

- Windows - x64

This add-on uses native C++ code for receiving events from Blender.
So Windows x86, Linux, and macOS does not work correctly.

## In the Future

I will support the following platforms in the future:

- Linux - x64 ([#20](https://github.com/mika-f/blender-drag-and-drop/issues/20))
