Animation Auto Assignment is an editor extension for Unity to automatically re-assign animation clips to the object based on the hierarchy movements of the animation clip.
It is useful when you want to refactor your animation clips (such as changing the hierarchy of the object) and you don't want to re-assign animation clips manually.

This extension supports the following changes of the object in hierarchy:

- Move to other location
- Rename
- Recursively renaming and moving

It can be avoiding `Missing Property` on the animation clip when you refactor (and changing) your animation clips.
