Constraint by Humanoid can be used from the `Natsuneko Laboratory` > `Constraint by Humanoid` in the menu bar.
After the menu is opened, you can select the target GameObject and humanoid bone to configure constraint components.

* Source GameObject is the GameObject that you want to configure constraint components.
* Destination GameObject is the GameObject that you want to sync the position and rotation of the source GameObject.
* Exclude GameObjects is the GameObjects that you want to exclude from the constraint configuration.

In many cases, the movement is aligned with the source bone, so in that case set the Rotation Constraint to the Constraint to be used.
After setting the constraint, press the `Apply Changes` button to configure the constraint component.
