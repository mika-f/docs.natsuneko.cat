## Fair Use Guidelines

All plans include usage that is subject to these fair use guidelines.
Below is a rule-of-thumb for determining which projects fall within our definition of "fair use" and which do not.

### Commercial usage

Free accounts are restricted to non-commercial personal use only.
All commercial usage of platform required either a Bronze or greater supporter.
Commercial usage is defined as any request that is used for the purpose of financial gain of anyone involved in any part of the production of the project, including a paid employee or consultant writing the code. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Any method of requesting or processing payment from visitors of the site
- Advertising the sale of a product or service
- Receiving payment to create, update, or host the site
- Affiliate linking is the primary purpose of the site
- The inclusion of advertisements, including but not limited to online advertising platforms like Google AdSense

But asking for donations does not fall under commercial usage.
