Material Split View can be used from the `Natsuneko Laboratory` > `Split Material` in the menu bar.  
And set the material you want to compare to the `Left Material` in `Right Material` field.

By the default, if the material inspector is too long to display, the inspector will be displayed in the scroll view and sync it left and right view.
