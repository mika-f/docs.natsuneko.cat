Automatic Material Duplicator is an editor extension for Unity to duplicate materials automatically when you duplicate GameObjects that attached material(s) in the hierarchy.
It is useful when you want to duplicate GameObjects with materials and want to keep the original materials and avatar modifications.
Duplication is applied to recursively, so you can duplicate GameObjects with its children.
